# Notes and Stata code

*This page is currently under construction, and is being live updated, so things are moving around. Use the material at your own risk!*

This section aims to cover the papers with some discussion of the theory but mostly a deep dive into the Stata code.


Before we start, I would like to add a glossary, since variable names, and definitions, vary across the papers and it quickly becomes intractable to follow what is going on across the different papers:

| Symbol | Meaning | 
| $$ i $$ | panel id |
| $$ t $$ | time variable |
| $$ Y $$ | outcome variable |
| $$ P $$ | =1 if post treatment period |
| $$ D $$ | =1 if treated observation |
| $$ \epsilon $$ | error term |
